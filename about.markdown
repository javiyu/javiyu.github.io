# About me

I am Javier Jiménez, a spanish software engineer with more than 10 years of experience.

I have a strong knowledge of web technologies. I consider myself a very pragmatic and product focused developer. I have lead small teams. I have contributed to a lot of Ruby on Rails projects, I have experience with Node.js, Go and I have done frontend development (React, CSS) as well.
